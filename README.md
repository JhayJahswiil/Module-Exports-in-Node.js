<!-- ABOUT MY WORK -->

In my BACK-END folder i created a app.js file
Then I created two folders and named them 'about-me' and 'my-friend' respectively.
In each of the folders, i created a javascript file each in each folder with the names 'about.js' and 'friend.js' respectively
I created objects in each Javascript file of each folder.

In the 'about-me' folder and 'about.js' file, i created an object with the name 'aboutMe' that references details about me such us: name, age, address and marital status.
In the 'my-friend' folder and 'friend.js' file, i also created an object that references details about my friend such us: name, age, address and marital status.

After which i created a function with the name 'infoAboutMe' in my 'about.js' file and returned the values in my object and the logged in out.
Then i exported the details of 'friend.js' file in 'my-friend' folder by using the require method

I then exported the details of 'about.js' file in the 'about-me' folder into my 'app.js' file by using the require method.
I then logged it out
